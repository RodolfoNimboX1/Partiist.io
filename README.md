# Partist.io
An web app to make a party list, distribute costs and make a fun playlist for the party

# Overview - what does it do?
This application will help the Party organizer keep track of all the goods he/she needs for a social gathering. It will help create a list of products to buy and add that list to an online shopping cart from Walmart so it can be delivered. The list will take into account the number of assistants.

With the app you will also be able to select several categories of music so it can sincronize with Spotify and generate for your a set of playlist you can play at your party.

# What job is the user trying to accomplish?
Partist is going to be used as a party management system. When planning a party you always need 3 things:
1.The People
2.The Food
3.The Music

So with Partist the user will be able to create a "Party Event" where he/she can gather the number of participants, create an order list on Walmart to have it delivered on the date it is needed, and to provide a list of cool music to play on that day.

# Integrations:
